# Salaryman's Dungeon

**Salaryman's Dungeon** is a satirical 2D grid-based roguelite where you play as a burnt-out office worker fighting through a procedurally generated corporate hellscape.

Built with **Phaser 3**, **TypeScript**, and **Vite**, it combines turn-based combat, resource management (HP, Burnout, Credits), and dungeon crawling mechanics in a modern "SaaS" (Software as a Service) aesthetic.

## Features
*   **Procedural Office Levels**: Explore infinitely generated 11x11 rooms filled with Desks, Water Coolers, and Server Racks.
*   **Turn-Based Combat**: Strategic grid combat against Interns, Managers, and Rogue Printers.
*   **Resource Management**: Balance your Health and **Burnout**. High Burnout makes you vulnerable!
*   **Interactive World**: Drink coffee to heal, use Vending Machines, and read gibberish on Whiteboards.
*   **Interaction**: **Tap-to-Move** navigation and **Point-and-Click** shooting (Stapler).

## Tech Stack
*   **Engine**: Phaser 3
*   **Language**: TypeScript
*   **Build Tool**: Vite
*   **Assets**: SVG-based workflow
